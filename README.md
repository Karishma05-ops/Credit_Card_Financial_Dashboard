# 📊 Credit Card Customer & Transaction Analysis Dashboards

Welcome to my first data visualization project on GitHub! This repository showcases two interactive Power BI dashboards created from real-world-inspired datasets related to credit card customers and their transaction behaviors. The goal is to extract actionable insights from both customer demographics and transaction trends to support business decision-making.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is divided into two key reports:

### 1. 🧍‍♂️ Credit Card Customer Report
**Objective**: Analyze customer profiles to understand usage patterns and predict churn.

**Key Insights:**
- Customer age group, gender, and income distribution
- Credit card limit and balance behavior
- Customer satisfaction levels
- Churn analysis
